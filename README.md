# Mini Course in Dynamic Structural Econometrics, UAB, September 12-16, 2022

This repository contains teaching materials for lectures in a short PhD course in **Dynamic Structural Econometrics** to be held in Barcelona September 12-16, 2022. Repository will be updated as we go a along. 

## Course description 
The overall purpose of the course is to provide a fundamental understanding of dynamic programming models and their empirical application. 

The dynamic programming framework has been extensively used in economic modeling because it is sufficiently rich to model almost any problem involving sequential decision making over time and under uncertainty. Prominent examples are saving/consumption decisions, retirement behavior, investment, labor supply/demand, occupational choice, housing decisions. 

The course will maiinly focus on introducing participants to the basic numerical tools, solution algorithms and estimation methods nessesary to carry out structural estimation of single agent discrete and continuous decision problems. The focus is primarily on helping students develop the skills for programming solution algorithms and estimators.  
 


## [Part I:  Structural estimation of dynamic discrete choice models](https://github.com/bschjerning/dp_uab/tree/main/1_dynamic_discrete_choice)      
In the first part of lectures on dynamic discrete choice models we will consider a variety of methods to structurally estimate dynamic discrete choice models (NFXP, MPEC, NPL, CCP type estimators). As a testbed for comparison we will use the canonical Bus Engine Replacement model in Rust's 1987 *Econometrica* paper.

## [Part II: Structural estimation of models with continuous and discrete choices](https://github.com/bschjerning/dp_uab/tree/main/2_discrete_continuous_choice)
In the second series of lectures on dynamic discrete-continuous choice models we will consider state of the art solution methods for models that combine continuous and discrete choices. We start with a simple consumption savings model, and then move on to models that combine discrete and continuous choices and show how state of the art methods (DC-EGM) can be used to solve and estimate a class of Discrete-Continuous Dynamic Choice Model fast and accurately.
